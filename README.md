## Introduction

The PrismXL Image Generator is a standalone desktop application designed to harness the power of diffusion models, specifically leveraging the `RunDiffusion/Juggernaut-XL-v9` model. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools for crafting the perfect image, from basic text-to-image generation to fine-grained control over advanced parameters. The application is built with a focus on performance, responsiveness, and user experience, featuring asynchronous generation to prevent UI freezes, real-time system resource monitoring, and a host of workflow-enhancing utilities.

## Key Features

### Generation Engine
- **High-Quality Model**: Natively integrates the powerful `Juggernaut-XL-v9` diffusion model.
- **Advanced Parameter Control**: Adjust Inference Steps, CFG Scale, and CLIP Skip for precise creative control.
- **Batch & Grid Generation**: Generate multiple images from a single prompt to explore variations efficiently.
- **Multiple Resolutions**: Supports a wide range of resolutions, including standard and widescreen formats.
- **Reproducibility**: Use custom seeds to recreate previous results.
- **Optimized Performance**: Automatically enables VAE tiling for high-resolution images to conserve memory.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizes CUDA for GPU-accelerated generation with a fallback to CPU if needed.

### User Interface
- **Modern & Responsive UI**: Built with PySide6 for a clean, fast, and native cross-platform experience.
- **Custom Frameless Window**: A sleek, modern design with a custom title bar.
- **Light & Night Modes**: Switch between themes for your visual comfort.
- **Image Viewer**: Displays generated images in a grid with thumbnails and a detailed main view.
- **Magnifying Loupe**: An interactive zoom tool to inspect image details directly in the viewer.
- **Modular Layout**: Re-arrange UI sections via drag-and-drop to customize your workspace.

### Workflow & Tools
- **Prompt Library**: Save, categorize, search, and reuse your favorite prompts.
- **Built-in Spell Checker**: Catches typos in your prompts and offers corrections to improve generation quality.
- **Real-time Progress**: Monitor generation progress with a detailed progress bar, status updates, and time estimates.
- **System Resource Monitor**: Keep an eye on RAM and GPU memory usage directly within the application.
- **Live Rendering**: (Optional) Watch your image come to life with a real-time preview of the generation process for 512x512 images.
- **Metadata Saving**: Automatically saves generation parameters (prompt, seed, steps, etc.) in a JSON file alongside the saved image.
- **Persistent Settings**: The application remembers your UI layout, theme, and generation settings between sessions.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: PySide6 (The official Qt for Python project)
- **AI/ML**:
  - PyTorch
  - Hugging Face Diffusers
  - Transformers
  - Accelerate
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **System Utilities**: Psutil, GPUtil
- **Miscellaneous**: Pyspellchecker

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1.  **Python**: Version 3.9 or newer.
2.  **Git**: For cloning the repository.
3.  **NVIDIA GPU (Recommended)**: For hardware-accelerated generation. Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers and a compatible CUDA Toolkit version installed.

### Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PrismXL-Image-Generator.git
    cd PrismXL-Image-Generator
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    A `requirements.txt` file should be provided. To ensure PyTorch is installed with the correct CUDA support for your system, it is highly recommended to first visit the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install it using the command provided there.
    
    Example for CUDA 11.8:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```    
    Then, install the remaining dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *If a `requirements.txt` is not available, install the core packages:*
    ```bash
    pip install PySide6 diffusers transformers accelerate torch numpy Pillow psutil GPUtil pyspellchecker safetensors
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, run the application from the root directory of the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

The main window will appear. Follow these steps to generate your first image:
1.  **Enter a Prompt**: Type a description of the image you want to create in the "Prompt" text area.
2.  **Enter a Negative Prompt (Optional)**: Type concepts you wish to exclude in the "Negative Prompt" area.
3.  **Adjust Settings (Optional)**: Use the sliders and dropdowns in the "Advanced Options" section to fine-tune the generation process.
4.  **Generate**: Click the "Generate" button. The UI will remain responsive while the image is being created.
5.  **View and Save**: The generated image(s) will appear on the right. You can select a thumbnail to view it larger, and use the "Save" button to save the selected image to your computer. Right-click the "Save" button to save all images from the current grid.

## Configuration and Data

- **Settings**: The application saves UI and user preferences automatically. On Windows, these settings are stored in the registry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Sapphire\PrismXL`.
- **Image Autosaves**: All generated images are automatically saved for your convenience in a user-specific directory:
  - **Windows**: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.sapphire_prismxl\images\`
  - **macOS/Linux**: `/home/<YourUsername>/.sapphire_prismxl/images/`
- **Prompt Library**: Your saved prompts are stored in `prompt_library.json` within the same `.sapphire_prismxl` directory.
- **Logs**: A detailed log file, `image_generator.log`, is created in the application's root directory for troubleshooting purposes.
